# Reverse Insertion Sort

Consider the code for insertion sort we covered in class:

```javascript
function insertionSort(arr) {
  for(var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    var val = arr[i];
    var j;
    for(j = i; j > 0 && arr[j-1] > val; j--) {
      arr[j] = arr[j-1];
    }
    arr[j] = val;
  }
  return arr;
}
```

Change this function such that it works from the end of the array rather than
the beginning, `insertionSortReverse()` -- only the direction of
iterating over the elements is reversed, the array is still sorted the same way
(ascending). Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided
some basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Average-Case Time Complexity of Insertion Sort

In the lectures, we covered that insertion sort has best-case time complexity of
$\Theta(n)$ and worst-case time complexity of $\Theta(n^2)$. What is the
average-case time complexity ($\Theta$)?

Hint: Think about what happens in each iteration of the loop, and how often the
loop is executed. Keep in mind that for asymptotic analysis we don't care about
constant factors.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is
most important -- you can easily find the answer, but you need to demonstrate
that you've understood the concept. Add your answer to this markdown file.


## My Time Complexity of Insertion Sort

The best-case time complexity is $\Theta(n)$ because the best-case is a sorted array
where the inner loop will never run, thus only the outer loop runs, and it runs $n$
times. 

The worst-case time complexity is $\Theta(n^2)$ because the worst-case is an array
in reverse sorted order, which would require both loops to run the maximum number of times
they can. 

This means that an average case would be any array that isn't sorted in ascending, or descending
order. Although in this situation the inner loop would definitely run fewer times than it 
does in the worst-case scenario, it would still give us a runtime complexity of $\Theta(n^2)$.
